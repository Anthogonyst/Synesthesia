# Synesthesia
 An educational piano game developed in Unity


  Have you ever wanted to play piano? Wonder how musicians read and write music? Allow Louise, your fellow music student, to give you a crash course into the audacious world of music. As a beginner, you will learn how to find the right keys on the piano and how to find notes on sheet music!


Developed in Unity 2.2018 in December 2019, this project was part of a group project with the prospect of higher education and accessibility.
